# Memory_Optimization_on_GAN

Here are the steps of the implementation for your GAN model training with memory optimization:

# 1. Import Required Libraries

Import necessary libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, and others for building and training the GAN model.

Set mixed precision policy for memory optimization using TensorFlow's mixed_float16.


# 2. Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduler
Define a dynamic learning rate scheduler function (dynamic_lr_scheduler) to adjust the learning rate based on the epoch number.


# 3. Data Generator
Define a data generator (data_generator) to yield batches of data from the Fashion MNIST dataset in a memory-efficient manner.

Normalize the images to the range [-1, 1] and reshape them to the appropriate dimensions for the model.


# 4. Build the Generator Model
Implement the build_generator function to define the architecture of the generator.

Use layers like Dense, LeakyReLU, Conv2DTranspose, and BatchNormalization to construct the generator.

Print the model summary to verify the architecture.


# 5. Build the Discriminator Model
Implement the build_discriminator function to define the architecture of the discriminator.

Use layers like Flatten, Dense, LeakyReLU, Dropout, and BatchNormalization to construct the discriminator.

Print the model summary to verify the architecture.


# 6. Compile the GAN Model
Implement the compile_gan function to compile the GAN by combining the generator and discriminator.

Compile both the generator and discriminator using separate optimizers.

Set the discriminator to non-trainable when compiling the combined GAN model to avoid altering the discriminator weights during generator training.


# 7. Prepare Checkpoint Directory
Create a checkpoint directory to save model weights periodically during training.


# 8. Initialize Optimizers
Access the optimizers for both the generator and discriminator from the compiled models for gradient updates.


# 9. Training Function with Memory Management
Define the train function to handle the training loop with memory management techniques.

Accumulate gradients to reduce memory usage by splitting updates across several steps (accumulate_steps).

Use a dynamic learning rate scheduler within the training loop.

Perform the forward and backward passes using tf.GradientTape to compute and accumulate gradients.

Apply accumulated gradients to update model weights and reset accumulated gradients after each update.

Save checkpoints periodically and clear TensorFlow sessions to manage memory usage.


# 10. Generate Images During Training
Define the generate_images function to generate and display images from the trained generator model at different epochs.


#  11. Start Training
Call the train function with the data generator, number of epochs, batch size, and latent dimension to begin the training process.

The training loop will continuously update the generator and discriminator, apply memory management techniques, and save model checkpoints.


# 12. Save and Clear Memory Periodically
During training, save the generator model weights and clear memory periodically to prevent memory overflows.

Use garbage collection (gc.collect()) and TensorFlow's session clearing (tf.keras.backend.clear_session()) to free up memory.


By following these steps, you create a memory-efficient GAN model implementation suitable for training on limited hardware resources. L
